# Risc-V-Pipelined-Architecture
This project implements a basic 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor. The architecture includes stages for IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB. It demonstrates instruction execution in parallel stages, improving throughput. Hazards (data, control, and structural) have not been handled in this implementation.
